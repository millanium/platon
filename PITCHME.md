## What is Security testing?

The goal of security testing is to identify the threats in the system and measure its potential vulnerabilities. It also helps in detecting all possible security risks in the system and help developers in fixing these problems through coding.

## Types of Security testing

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: This is done through automated software to scan a system against known vulnerability signatures.
- **Security Scanning**: It involves identifying network and system weaknesses, and later provides solutions for reducing these risks. This scanning can be performed for both Manual and Automated scanning.
- **Penetration testing**: This kind of testing simulates an attack from a malicious hacker. This testing involves analysis of a particular system to check for potential vulnerabilities to an external hacking attempt.
- **Risk Assessment**: This testing involves analysis of security risks observed in the organization. Risks are classified as  Low, Medium and High. This testing recommends controls and measures to reduce the risk.
- **Security Auditing**: This is an internal inspection of Applications and Operating systems for security flaws. Audit can also be done via line by line inspection of code
- **Ethical hacking**: It's hacking an Organization Software systems. Unlike malicious hackers ,who steal for their own gains , the intent is to expose security flaws in  the system.
- **Posture Assessment**: This combines Security scanning, Ethical Hacking and Risk Assessments to show an overall security posture of an organization.
